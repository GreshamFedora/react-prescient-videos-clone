Prescient Videos - a platform for parents of multilingual kids to facilitate their kids' language learning.

The aim of this project was to scratch a personal itch: as playlists are not allowed for kids' videos on YT, the desire emerged for a more curated approach to access to multilingual content in a manner that allows parents of multilingual children to provide access to content to their children regardless of whether they know the language themselves or not.

How It's Made:

Tech used: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, & JavaScript

Built out a relatively simple interface using primarily react/JS to enable for access to multilingual content in a style akin to the familiar experience provided by YouTube so that young children accustomed to using YouTube when presented with this interface could transition seamlessly.

Optimizations to do:
-Add in children/parent mode to enable parents to present interface that only provides access to content in a single language at a time.
-Fix minor error with search bar appearance on mobile (doesn't affect performance)


Lessons Learned:
Working with others' APIs can always provide surprises.
